## Policy Evolution

The following video visualizes the learning progress of the reinforcement learning agent across **exactly three training stages** in the `highway-fast-v0` environment.

**Top → Bottom:**
1. **Untrained Agent** — random policy, crashes almost immediately  
2. **Half-Trained Agent** — survives longer but still makes unsafe decisions  
3. **Fully Trained Agent** — stable high-speed driving without collisions
